### ✅ When to Start On-Premise (First)
Choose **on-prem** if you need:
- 🧪 Tight control: fine-grained debugging, local logs, fast iteration
- 🧰 Lower initial cost: no cloud billing surprises
- 🔌 Offline setup/testing: for working without internet or cloud dependencies
- 🔐 Security prototyping: to build and harden internal PKI, vaults, etc.
- 🛠️ Custom integration: legacy systems, local hardware, or firewalled data sources

Ideal for:
👉 Building out the dataflow logic in NiFi, trying out Kafka, fallback services, and proving ingestion works\
end-to-end.

### ✅ When to Go Straight to the Cloud
Choose cloud-first if you want:
- ☁️ Scalable testing of production-like behavior
- 📊 Observability tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, GCP Monitoring)
- 🧪 Staging environments
- 🧰 Managed services (PostgreSQL, S3, GCS, etc.)
- 🧑‍💻 Remote team collaboration

Ideal for:
👉 Setting up automated CI/CD, load testing your ingestion at scale, and preparing for deployment pipelines.

### 🚦 Recommended Hybrid Approach
1. **Develop core ingestion + retry logic on-premise** (Docker/MicroK8s, local NiFi + PostgreSQL)
2. Mirror it to the cloud using IaC (Terraform, Helm charts, or GitHub Actions)
3. Test cloud-only integrations (e.g., GCP PubSub, AWS Lambda) in cloud env
4. Use **GitOps** to sync on-prem and cloud environments for parity

### 🔐 DevOps Tip
If you're using NiFi, MinIO, or Spring Boot locally, wrap them in docker-compose or Podman to mirror what\
you'd deploy in GCP, AWS, or Azure. This makes cloud migration seamless.
