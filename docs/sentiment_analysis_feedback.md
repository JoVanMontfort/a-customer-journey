# 🧠 Technical Analysis: Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback

## 📌 User Story
> **As a data scientist**, I want to apply sentiment analysis (e.g. using Python/Java NLP libraries) to customer feedback, so that I can detect emotional tone and extract key themes.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a robust sentiment analysis pipeline that:
- Analyzes emotional tone (positive, neutral, negative)
- Identifies key themes and recurring topics
- Processes structured and unstructured customer feedback
- Integrates into the customer journey data lake for unified analytics

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Track changes in customer sentiment over time
- Detect dissatisfaction in support tickets
- Surface product improvement suggestions from reviews
- Enable strategic decision-making via theme frequency analysis

## 🧪 Sentiment Analysis Strategy

1. **Lexicon-Based**
    - Tools: VADER, TextBlob
    - Pros: Simple, fast, no training needed
    - Cons: Limited context awareness

2. **Machine Learning-Based**
    - Tools: scikit-learn, BERT, RoBERTa via Hugging Face
    - Pros: Contextual understanding, better accuracy
    - Cons: Needs training data, compute-intensive

3. **Hybrid Approach**
    - Combine lexicon scoring with ML classification
    - Use rule-based tagging to enhance thematic accuracy

## 🧬 Unified Output Schema

```json
{
  "customer_id": "abc123",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-25T14:00:00Z",
  "feedback_text": "Support was slow, but the agent was friendly.",
  "sentiment_score": -0.2,
  "sentiment_label": "neutral",
  "themes": ["support", "response time", "agent behavior"]
}
```

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Metric	Description
- Accuracy	Correctly labeled sentiment ratio
- Precision / Recall	Per sentiment category
- F1-Score	Balanced performance indicator
- Topic Coherence	Relevance and consistency of extracted themes

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Ethics

- Anonymize or pseudonymize personal identifiers
- Avoid profiling individuals with sentiment data
- Ensure compliance with GDPR / privacy laws

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Select baseline models (TextBlob/VADER)
- Annotate or gather labeled data for fine-tuning
- Train/test ML models and validate performance
- Integrate with feedback pipeline and store results in MinIO
- Build dashboards to visualize sentiment trends and themes
- Prepared for GitHub documentation — giving voice to your customers through AI 💬
